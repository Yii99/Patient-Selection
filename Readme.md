## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on. Target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring.  


**Expected Hospitalization Time Regression Model:** Utilizing a synthetic dataset(denormalized at the line level augmentation) built off of the UCI Diabetes readmission dataset. we need to build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial.

This project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level, with appropriate filtering and preprocessing/feature engineering of key medical code sets. 

### Dataset
Due to healthcare PHI regulations (HIPAA, HITECH), there are limited number of publicly available datasets and some datasets require training and approval. So, for the purpose of this exercise, we are using a dataset from UC Irvine that has been modified for this course. Please note that it is limited in its representation of some key features such as diagnosis codes which are usually an unordered list in 835s/837s (the HL7 standard interchange formats used for claims and remits).

## Dependencies
Using Anaconda consists of the following:

1. Install [`miniconda`](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your computer, by selecting the latest Python version for your operating system. If you already have `conda` or `miniconda` installed, you should be able to skip this step and move on to step 2.
2. Create and activate * a new `conda` [environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html).

## Create and Activate the Environment

For Windows users, these following commands need to be executed from the **Anaconda prompt** as opposed to a Windows terminal window. For Mac, a normal terminal window will work. 

#### Git and version control
These instructions also assume you have `git` installed for working with Github from a terminal window, but if you do not, you can download that first with the command:
```
conda install git
```

If you'd like to learn more about version control and using `git` from the command line, take a look at our [free course: Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123).
